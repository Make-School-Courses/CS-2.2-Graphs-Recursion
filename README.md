# CS 2.2 Advanced Recursion and Graphs

This course covers graph theory, data structures, algorithms, and analysis. Key concepts include graph traversals, pathfinding, recursion, greedy algorithms, memoization and dynamic programming. Students will build an original project whose underlying structure requires the use of graph structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems such as airplane routing, social networking, and board games.

Graphs can be used to model and solve a wide variety of problems, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete your degree here at Make School! Understanding graphs allows you to build models of these problems and use those models to find optimal or best case solutions.

## Class Work

### Assignments

This course includes 5 assignments, assigned weekly and linked in the schedule above.

### Projects

- [Graph Properties and Algorithms Project](Projects/Graph-Project.md)
  - [Project Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hq2D0HFCVIqkEI0HvE3SxCUlhNkSdG1Xoe62b3g9wp4/edit?usp=sharing)

### Quizzes and Final Assessment

This course includes 3 practice quizzes and 1 final assessment. The quizzes are designed to level up your skills and illuminate the areas in which you can improve.

The final assessment will contain similar material to the quizzes, and will cover the same topics.

If you earn ≥70% on all 3 practice quizzes, you do not need to take the final.

## Evaluation

**To pass this course, you must complete the following:**:

- Pass all but 1 homework assignment (≥70%)
- Pass the final project (≥70%)
- Pass the final assessment (≥70%) **OR** earn ≥70% on all 3 practice quizzes

**In order to pass this course, you must also:**

- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Late Assignment Policy

In this class, we will be using student submissions as material for in-class discussions and activities, such as peer code reviews. **If you do not submit your homework assignments by the deadline, you will miss out on these opportunities.** However, no explicit late penalty will be applied for submissions under 1 week late. You may also re-submit your work to correct errors and increase your homework score.

Assignments or corrections submitted **more than 7 days (1 week) late** will **not** be accepted.

The **absolute last day** to submit any assignment will be **Friday, March 5 at 11:59 PM**. After that, no other extensions may be granted even in extenuating circumstances due to a hard deadline for submitting grades.

If you require accommodations or have extenuating circumstances such as prolonged illness, please contact your instructor to request an extension.

## Academic Honesty Policy

At Make School, we highly encourage collaboration between students on assignments. Working with other people is the best way to learn!

However, there's a big difference between **collaboration** (writing code together with another person) and **plagiarism** (copying code from a classmate or outside source without providing proper attribution). 

Here are some guidelines to follow in order to avoid plagiarism:

1. If you are looking at an outside source for help, **close the window** containing the code before writing your own solution.
1. Do not write down a line of code unless you **completely understand** how it works. (This is true even if the source you're referencing is the lesson slides/examples/etc!)
1. If your code is still similar to an outside source or another student's, **provide attribution** by adding a comment to your code explaining where it was taken from.

We take academic honesty very seriously at Make School. The consequences for violating the policy are as follows:

- You will be required to write a [Self-Reflection Letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/140_PHfDh7gu33OZI_caxEtvNzAlAepjnGcbQcXZ-MRo/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect on how your actions affected others.
- If this is your first offense, you may be permitted to redo the assignment for a reduced grade (at the instructor's discretion).
- The incident will be added to your permanent record at Make School and you may be placed on a Participation Improvement Plan (PIP).

For subsequent offenses, more serious consequences may be considered. For more information, please see [Make School's academic honesty policy](https://make.sc/academic-honesty-policy).
