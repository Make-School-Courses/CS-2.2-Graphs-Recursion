# CS 2.2 Advanced Recursion and Graphs

This course covers graph theory, data structures, algorithms, and analysis. Key concepts include graph traversals, pathfinding, recursion, greedy algorithms, memoization and dynamic programming. Students will build an original project whose underlying structure requires the use of graph structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems such as airplane routing, social networking, and board games.

Graphs can be used to model and solve a wide variety of problems, including systems of roads, airline flights from city to city, how the Internet is connected, or even the sequence of classes you must take to complete your degree here at Make School! Understanding graphs allows you to build models of these problems and use those models to find optimal or best case solutions.

## Prerequisites:  

- [CS 1.3](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-1.3-Core-Data-Structures)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

- Describe common graph algorithms including graph traversals, pathfinding, greedy algorithms, recursion, and dynamic programming.
- Model and solve real world problems using graph algorithms.
- Implement graph algorithms in code.
- Develop algorithmic thinking skills to expand on common graph algorithms and improve problem solving approaches.

## Class Assignments

This course includes 5 assignments, assigned weekly and linked in the schedule above. For Assignment 5, you will have a choice between completing Assignment 5a (Max Flow) or Assignment 5b (Review).

### Projects

- [Graph Properties and Algorithms Project](Assignments/Graph-Project.md)
  - [Project Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hq2D0HFCVIqkEI0HvE3SxCUlhNkSdG1Xoe62b3g9wp4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Evaluation

**To pass this course, you must earn at least a 70% weighted average, according to the following breakdown**:

- Assignments & Class Participation: 50%
- Quizzes/Assessments: 30%
- Final Project: 20%

In order to pass this course, you must also:

- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Late Assignment Policy

If you submit an assignment after the due date, your instructor will apply a late penalty as follows:

- Late assignments that are submitted **no later that 2 days (48 hours)** after the deadline will be given a **10% late penalty**.
- Another **10% late penalty** will be applied for **every 2 days (48 hours)** that pass after the deadline. For example, an assignment that is submitted 5 days late will receive a 30% late penalty.
- Assignments submitted **more than 7 days (1 week) late** will **not** be accepted.

Late assignment penalties **do not apply** to resubmissions. You may redo and resubmit your old assignments as many times as you would like up to the final course deadline. _**In other words, I will only consider your first submission when applying a late penalty.**_

The **absolute last day** to submit any assignment will be **Friday, July 17 at 11:59 PM**.

If you require accommodations or have extenuating circumstances such as prolonged illness, please contact your instructor to request an extension.

## A note on code:

Much of the code you will be implementing in this class is for standard algorithms and thus is readily available from many sources. By using these resources, we can focus on deepening our understanding of the algorithms themselves and on the process of solving real world problems with these algorithms.  This means it may be likely that class members will have relatively similar algorithmic implementations, however, in keeping with the [Academic Honesty Policy](https://make.sc/academic-honesty-policy), you are expected to always give credit to code sources (online or classmates), write each line of code yourself with full understanding, add appropriate comments, and fully test your code.
